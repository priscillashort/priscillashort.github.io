      Hash Table

    <p>Big-O Efficiency: Can Approach O(1)</p>
    <h3>
      A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later. 
      Each position of the hash table, often called a slot, can hold an item and is named by an integer value 
      starting at 0. For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1, a slot named 2, and so on. 
      Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty. We can implement a hash table by 
      using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value None. Figure 1 shows a hash table 
      of size m = 11. In other words, there are m slots in the table, named 0 through 10.

    <h3>
      The mapping between an item and the slot where that item belongs in the hash table is called the hash function. 
      The hash function will take any item in the collection and return an integer in the range of slot names, 
      between 0 and m - 1. Assume that we have the set of integer items 
      <br>
      54, 26, 93, 17, 77, and 31. 
      <br>
      Our first hash function, sometimes referred to as the “remainder method,” simply takes an item and divides 
      it by the table size, returning the remainder as its hash value (h(item) = item % 11). Table 4 gives all of the 
      hash values for our example items. Note that this remainder method (modulo arithmetic) will typically be present 
      in some form in all hash functions, since the result must be in the range of slot names.

      &emsp; &ensp; Item &emsp; &ensp; Hash Value
      <br>
      54 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 10
      <br>
      26 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 4
      <br>
      93 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 5
      <br>
      17 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 6
      <br>
      77 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 0
      <br>
      31 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 9
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the hash values have been computed, we can insert each item into the hash table at the designated 
      position as shown in Figure 2. Note that 6 of the 11 slots are now occupied. This is referred to as the 
      load factor, and is commonly denoted by λ = numberofitems/tablesize. For this example, λ = 6/11.

    <h3>
      Now when we want to search for an item, we simply use the hash function to compute the slot name for the item 
      and then check the hash table to see if it is present. This searching operation is O(1), since a constant 
      amount of time is required to compute the hash value and then index the hash table at that location. 
      If everything is where it should be, we have found a constant time search algorithm.
      <!--
      <br>
      You can probably already see that this technique is going to work only if each item maps to a unique location 
      in the hash table. For example, if the item 44 had been the next item in our collection, it would have a hash 
      value of 0 (44 % 11 = 0). Since 77 also had a hash value of 0, we would have a problem. According to the hash 
      function, two or more items would need to be in the same slot. This is referred to as a collision 
      (it may also be called a “clash”). Clearly, collisions create a problem for the hashing technique.
