							About me: <br>
							Growing up I was home schooled, but I never received an official diploma. 
							I held a full-time job at a Christian ministry for over 3 years from the time I was 17 till the time I was 21. 
							During which time my mother passed away on my 20th birthday. 
							After my time at the ministry I took the GED test and passed to graduate from high school officially. 
							A couple weeks after getting my GED I went on a mission's trip to Honduras. 
							About a week after getting back from Honduras I was hired by a tech support company here in Bend called Paladin Data Corp. 
							I worked there full time for 2.5 years. 
							I left to get a higher education and I have now completed the 1st year of an Associate's in Computer Science at Central Oregon Community College.
							After a year in school, my finances required that I work part time while completing my second year of school.
							I am now a software developer at Paladin Data Corp working 30 hours per week.
							I have been working as a developer for 6 months and I have been in the field for about 4 years.
							<br> <br>
							I have rather big goals. 
							After working in tech support and during my time working for a ministry, I discovered a strong interest in software development. 
							I very much enjoy learning and using programming languages. This has led to my current career in software development. 
							I plan to finish an Associate's degree (and someday a bachelors) in Computer Science. 
							I also have a strong interest in neurology and anything to do with the brain. 
							My ultimate goal is to be a software developer in the field of neuroscience. 
							My commitment to software development is strong. 
							I have taught myself the programming languages of Visual Basic and SQL script. 
							Through work and school, I have learned C#, C++, Python, CSS, and HTML. 
							I have spent many late nights at work off the clock learning these languages to someday do the work I love in computer programming.
